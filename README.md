# Software Engineer | Backend & API Development | FinTech

Hello! 

I'm a Software Engineer with over 5 years of experience building backend systems and RESTful APIs, focused on financial services and secure online payment platforms used by millions of people around the world.

## Mastercard Project Experience

I worked on a core payment platform for Mastercard, where I helped design and support microservice-based backend systems handling high-volume financial transactions.  
My responsibilities included building scalable APIs, integrating with enterprise services, and ensuring compliance with industry standards such as EMVCo and PCI DSS.  

As a **release owner**, I coordinated and planned release activities end-to-end â€” proactively identifying and addressing critical points in the deployment process. This strategic approach led to a **significant reduction in release time** and contributed to **lower operational costs** by improving efficiency and minimizing delivery risks.

I also collaborated closely under the **SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework)** methodology and worked with **global teams across multiple time zones (IST, CST, BRT)**, ensuring smooth communication, coordinated releases, and continuous delivery in a globally distributed environment.
